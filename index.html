         <p class="bio">I am a senior student at Thomas A. Edison High School, studying web development. I have experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to create a basic webpage. I'm interested in becoming a web developer and my future goal is to graduate high school and attend college to obtain a  bachelor's degree in computer science. </p>
